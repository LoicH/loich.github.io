I am Loïc Herbelot, a French data science student. 


## Work experience

(may be more precise in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/herbelot/))

### October 2019 → Now: Data Scientist Consultant in a global tech group

### November 2018 → May 2019: Data Scientist in an insurtech startup

### September 2016 → August 2018: 2-year apprenticeship at Trusted Labs

I did a lot of security-related development. I mainlyused Java to improve the software, and some C and python on the side. I used machine learning techniques to improve software attacks, such as reducing the quantity of information needed to perform an attack.

I implemented a neural network from a recent research paper in order to perform a new type of software attack.

### September 2016 → October 2019: Website development

I managed, improved and updated the website of a great friend and musician.

## Studies

### September 2017 - February 2018: semester of Data Science at UPMC
#### (Université Pierre et Marie Curie)

I participated in the "Data, Learning and Knowledge" curriculum (in French: "Données, Apprentissage et Connaissances") in one of the biggest universities in France. This semester covers lots of topics about machine learning, data science and big data, with classes such as ["Databases at large scale"](https://github.com/LoicH/M2-DAC/tree/master/BDLE), ["Data mining and social media"](https://github.com/LoicH/FDMS), ["Information retrieval"](https://github.com/LoicH/RI/) or "Modeling and reasoning with incomplete knowledge". 

### September 2015 - August 2018: Master of Science (Computer Science) at Télécom ParisTech 
#### With a specialization in Data Sciences

I did my Engineering Master at Telecom ParisTech, one of the best engineering schools in France. I did one year of generic computer science with various courses about programming, operating systems, calculus, probabilities, information theory, and projects such as [my first-year data mining & visualization project](https://github.com/LoicH/aps). I then specialized in data sciences and focused on machine learning, data base management, optimization and statistics, while doing an apprenticeship in a security firm to learn about security and how it works in the real world. My 3rd year consisted of one semester of courses about Data Science at Université Pierre et Marie Curie and one semester of internship in the same security company.


## Programming as a hobby

### Coding Challenges

I really like coding. [Here](https://github.com/LoicH/coding_challenges#coding-challenges) you can find the latest programming problems I solved, mainly Advent of Code ([2020](https://github.com/LoicH/coding_challenges/tree/main/advent_of_code_2020), [2021](https://github.com/LoicH/coding_challenges/tree/main/advent_of_code_2021)), some [LeetCode](https://github.com/LoicH/coding_challenges/tree/main/leetcode) and challenges from [Project Euler](https://github.com/LoicH/coding_challenges/tree/main/project_euler). 

### Prologin 2016

I participated in the 2016 edition of the French National Computer Science Contest, for people under 20 y.o.

I passed the first qualification phase that included programming tasks done online, then went to the regional event that includes a written exam and programming problems to solve on a computer.
